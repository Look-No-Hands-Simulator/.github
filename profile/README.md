## Hello there! :) 
## This is the Look No Hands Formula Student Driverless Simulator, it was developed with support from Oxford Brookes University as a dissertation project and with love for Oxford Brookes Racing: Autonomous, the university's team. But is open source for all teams, all over the world, and you can use it if you are not on a team too or whoever you are as long as you don't use it for profit.

## What is formula Student Driverless?
It's a student competition for creating autonomous racing cars in university teams. 

## What's the purpose of this simulator?
It is to help teams to test their ROS2 based algorithms by creating simulated sensor data that can publish onto topics that can then be used by algorithms to send back control commands by publishing ADS_DV_Msgs topics which the simulator will subscribe to and actuate the car in Unity to accelerate, brake. The simulator aims to have different environments and interface with missions. 

## How to use

## Where did the funny name come from?
At my time at Oxford Brookes Racing: Autonomous this joke was made because the cars are autonomously driven.
